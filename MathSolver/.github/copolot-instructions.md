When adding documentation to a code file, it is important to ensure that the documentation is clear and concise. 
The documentation should provide a brief overview of the purpose of the code file, as well as any important details 
or instructions for using the code. Additionally, the documentation should be formatted in a way that is easy to 
read and understand, with clear headings and sections to help organize the information. 
By following these guidelines, you can create effective documentation that will help others understand and use your code more easily.

Add comments on important/interesting parts of the code.

Use <summary> tags for classes, methods, functions, and enum values.
